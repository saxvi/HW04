welcome to space. you are navigating through a strangely aggressive asteroid belt! honestly it's really weird why are they so fast.

to move around, use the **up, down, left, and right** buttons. you can also dodge (by increasing your movement speed for a single movement) by using **left shoulder while going left and up, and right shouldder while going right and down**.

the asteroids will damage your ship if they hit you, so be careful to avoid them! if there is a collision, though, don't worry. you have **five chances** before it's game over!

it's not all bad, though! there will be **coins that spawn** periodically, and if you collect them, your score will increase.

while in game, you can access the pause menu by **pressing start**, and from there you can see the scoreboard if you **press a**, and quit the game by **pressing select**.
